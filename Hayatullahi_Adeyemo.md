My name is Hayatullahi Adeyemo, a trainee at Code Your Future (CYF).
I had a degree in Computer Science at the Usmanu Danfodiyo University, Sokoto.
I am happily married with two wonderful kids.
I like football and tennis. This is because I enjoy dribbling and it makes me burn some calories.
My favourite food is pounded yam with egusi soup garnished with vegetables and crayfish. It makes me feel good and satisfied.

I like to learn new things and as such I have completed no less than 185 online course offered by Coursera, LinkedInLearning, Udemy, Mathworks, etc.
I hope I've impressed you?
