What three problem does Git & Github solve?

Git and GitHub solve the following three problems:

1. Version Control: Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes in their code over time. It helps to manage different versions of files and facilitates collaboration among multiple developers by merging changes seamlessly.

2. Collaboration: Git and GitHub enable developers to work collaboratively on the same project. Multiple developers can contribute to a codebase simultaneously, and Git's branching and merging capabilities make it easier to manage code changes and avoid conflicts.

3. Remote Repositories and Backup: GitHub provides a platform for hosting remote repositories of Git projects. This enables developers to store their code in the cloud, making it accessible from anywhere. Additionally, it serves as a backup for the code, protecting against data loss due to hardware failures or accidents.
