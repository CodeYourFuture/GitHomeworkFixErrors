# Linus's Homework

## 1. What is 2 + 2?

4

## 2. What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is a high-level, dynamic programming language used to create interactive and dynamic web content. It runs in browsers and on servers (via Node.js), enabling features like form validation, DOM manipulation, and asynchronous data fetching.

## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

**Git** and **GitHub** solve these main problems:

  **Version Control** – Track changes in code, revert to earlier versions, and manage revisions efficiently.

  **Collaboration** – Allow multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts.

  **Backup & Remote Access** – Store code safely online (via GitHub) and access it from anywhere.

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

**Forking** a repository creates a copy of a project, allowing changes, experimentation, or independent development without affecting the original.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

Cloning a repository creates a **local copy** of the project on a computer, allowing the user to view, edit, and manage the code offline.

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request** is a method for proposing changes from one branch or repository to another, commonly used to review and merge code into a primary project.
