What three problems do Git & Github solve?

Git and GitHub solve the following problems:

1. Version control: Git helps to track and manage changes to code over time.

3. Code sharing and publishing: Developers can share their code with others, showcase their work, or contribute to open-source projects.

## Question 9

What happens when you `fork` a repository?

When you fork a repository, you create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account. This allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project.

## Question 10 

What happens when you clone a repository?

Cloning a repository means you are creating a local copy of the repository on your own machine. This allows you to work on the code locally, make changes, and then push those changes back to the repository on GitHub.

## Question 11

What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request (PR) is a proposal to merge your changes into another branch or the main project. It's a way to let others know about the changes you've made, and allows for code review before the changes are integrated into the project.

## Question 12

What is the Git History log?

The Git history log is a record of all the commits made in a repository. It allows you to see what changes have been made, who made them, and when they were made.

Committing your changes means saving your changes to the local Git repository with a descriptive message about what was modified. These committed changes can then be pushed to the remote repository.

## Question 16
