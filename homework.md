The commit command is used to save changes to a local repository after staging in Git. However, before you can save changes in Git, you have to tell Git which changes you want to save as you might have made tons of edits. A great way to do that is by adding a commit message to identify your changes.

## Question 18

I can ask traniees at CYF, on slack, stackoverflow, youtube but also if you are having trouble remembering commands or options for commands, you can use Git help.

    git help --all -  See all possible commands
