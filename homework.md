# Linus's Homework

## 1. What is 2 + 2?

4

## 2. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a high-level programming language used to make web pages interactive. It allows dynamic content updates, form validation, animations, and user interaction directly in the browser.

## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

Version Control:
Git tracks changes to files over time, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and maintain a complete history of the project.

Collaboration:
GitHub enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously by using features like branches, pull requests, and merge tools to integrate code safely and efficiently.

Backup and Remote Access:
Hosting code on GitHub acts as a secure backup and allows developers to access and contribute to their projects from anywhere.

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

When you fork a repository on GitHub, you create a copy of someone else's repository under your own GitHub account. This allows you to:

Freely make changes to the code without affecting the original project.

Experiment with ideas, fix bugs, or add features.

Later propose your changes to the original repository using a pull request.

Forking is a powerful way to learn from, build upon, and contribute to projectsâ€”especially in open-source communities.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

When you clone a repository, you download a full copy of it from GitHub to your local computer, including all files, history, and branches, so you can work on it offline.      

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request is a way to propose changes to a repository. You ask the project owner / maintainers to review and possibly merge your changes into the original code. Pull requests are essential in collaborative and open-source development.
