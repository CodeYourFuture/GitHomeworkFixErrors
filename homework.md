## Question 8

What three problems does Git & Github solve?

1) Allows one to share their work with others; having such work stored in a central structure called a repository.
2) Enables people to make their own changes to that work, and share it back; thereby assisting collaboration.
3) Allows one to keep track of all the changes made. One can even go back to older versions of their work to see what was tried before, or to undo changes.

## Question 9

What happens when you `fork` a repository?

You basically create a 'copy' of the source/main repository; so that you can work on it and edit it without affecting the original repository.

## Question 10 

What happens when you clone a repository?
Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.

## Question 11

What is a Pull Request?

It is a request to add changes to the owner's repository. That is, you have made changes to the original work and would like to submit and 'merge' the said changes onto the original main repository. So you make a request to the owner of your intent and await to see if the owner will approve of your changes. So you want the owner to "pull the changes" into their repository.

## Question 12

What is the Git History log?

It lets you see all the changes ever made to the repository in chronological order. The oldest at the bottom and the newest at the top. You can always see an old version of a file by looking in this History log, and if you want to get it back, you can just copy and paste it from the history view into your editor.

## Question 13

What does it mean to "push" changes to Github?

To push means to send your committed changes which you own locally, to a remote repository on GitHub.com, so that others may access them.

## Question 14

## Question 15

What does it mean to "Commit your changes"?

It means to save your changes to the local repository. Each time one does so, 'Git' creates a unique ID that allows one to keep record of what changes were made when and by who.

## Question 16

What program do we use to write code at CodeYourFuture?

## Question 17

What do you use "Commit Messages" for?
