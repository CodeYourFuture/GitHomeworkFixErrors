Version Control: Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to track changes to their code over time. 

Collaboration: GitHub is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, making it easier for developers to collaborate on projects. 

Backup and Sharing: By using Git and GitHub, developers can keep their codebase safely stored in remote repositories. 

## Question 9

What happens when you `fork` a repository?

You create a personal copy of the original repository under your GitHub account. This copy is entirely separate from the original repository and allows you to work on changes and improvements without affecting the original project.

## Question 10

When you clone a repository, you create a local copy of the entire repository, including all its files, branches, and commit history, on your local machine.

## Question 11

What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request (PR) is a request made by a developer to propose and submit changes to a repository on platforms like GitHub. It allows contributors to request code review and merge their changes into the main codebase.

## Question 12

What is the Git History log?

The Git History log is a chronological record of all the commits and changes made to a Git repository. It displays a list of commit messages, along with the commit author, date, and unique commit hash, allowing users to track the history of changes to the codebase over time.

To commit your changes means to save the changes you have made to the files in your local Git repository. It creates a snapshot of your work, including any additions, deletions, or modifications made to the files. Each commit is given a unique identifier (SHA-1 hash), which allows you to track and reference the changes later.

## Question 16

## Question 17

What do you use "Commit Messages" for?

Commit Messages are used to provide a brief and descriptive summary of the changes made in a Git commit. They serve as a communication tool to help team members understand the purpose and context of the changes, making it easier to track the history of the codebase and collaborate effectively.

## Question 18
