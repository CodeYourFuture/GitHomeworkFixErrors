## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository, also known as the "upstream" repository.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project. You can push your changes to the remote repository on GitHub.com, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.com.

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request (PR) is a mechanism in collaborative software development where a developer proposes changes to a codebase and requests that other developers review and approve the changes before they are integrated into the main branch. It's a way to submit changes, discuss them, and ensure quality before merging.
