## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

By addressing common problems like merge conflicts, protected branches, and branching strategy, teams can streamline their workflows and maximize the benefits of these essential tools.

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository, also known as the "upstream" repository.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?
