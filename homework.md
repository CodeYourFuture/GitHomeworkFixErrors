What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.

## Question 8
What three problem does Git & Github solve?
When people want to show off code to each other they can put it on Github
Track changes in your code across versions
It makes it easy to contribute to your open source projects
Markdown allows you to use a simple text editor to write formatted documents.

## Question 9
What happens when you `fork` a repository?
A fork is a copy of a repository that you manage. Forks let you make changes to a project without affecting the original repository. You can fetch updates from or submit changes to the original repository with pull requests.


## Question 10 
What happens when you clone a repostory?
create a new local directory for the repository, copy all the contents of the specified repository, create the remote tracked branches, and checkout an initial branch locally.




## Question 11
What is a Pull Request?
A pull request  is an event that takes place in software development when a contributor/developer is ready to begin the process of merging new code changes with the main project repository.

## Question 12
What is the Git History log?

## Question 13
What does it meant to "push" changes to Github?
When you push changes, you send the committed changes in your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub. If you change your project locally and want other people to have access to the changes, you must push the changes to GitHub.

## Question 14
What is Github?
 GitHub is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code. The primary benefit of GitHub is its version control system, which allows for seamless collaboration without compromising the integrity of the original project. The projects on GitHub are examples of open-source software.

## Question 15
What does it mean to "Commit your changes"?
The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository. Note that you have to explicitly tell Git which changes you want to include in a commit before running the "git commit" command. This means that a file won't be automatically included in the next commit just because it was changed.

## Question 16
What program do we use to write code at CodeYourFuture?
Visual studio code

## Question 17
What do you use "Commit Messages" for?
A “commit” command saves all the edits made to a local repository after it's placed in Git. You make tons of edits that you might not be able to recall later. So, before making the changes to any command line, you have to inform Git about it. A Git Commit Message helps identify all the changes in the documentation.

## Question 18
Where can I look to find help with Git?
Google
