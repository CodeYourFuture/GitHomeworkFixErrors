4

## Question 2

What is the opposite of Black?

White

## Question 3

What is the  2 * 3 * 6 * 1 * 10 * 34?

12240

## Question 4 

What does HTML stand for?

Hypertext Markup Language

## Question 5

What is CSS useful for?

-The design aspect of a website
-Bringing a website to life because it adds style, color and hover effects for example
-Positioning elements on a webpage
## Question 6

Using CSS, how would I select every `<h1>` tag on the page?

```css
h1 {

}
```

## Question 7

What is JavaScript?

My understanding of JavaScript is that it is a very useful programming language which is used to create interactive effects on a webpage. For example, JavaScript can enable a webpage to simply collect data inputted to a particular field but one can also tell the computer using the javascript language what it should do with the collected data. For instance, maybe we want to store the collected data in a particular order/format. We can then use JavaScript to achieve this goal.

## Question 8

What three problems does Git & Github solve?

1. Once our files are tracked by Git and pushed to Github the platform stores a copy of those files hence solving the problem of deleting a file in error on your local computer.
2. Because Git and GitHub serves as a version control it keeps a very detailed record or log of files which then allows us to track changes such as dates and times they were made etc. Since it has such precise capabilities it solves the problem of having to spend time searching for errors in our code if there is a bug as GitHub clearly pinpoints this information for us.
3. Last but not least, another feature of GitHub is control, though public, only the creator of a  main branch of a repository has authority to change or update the main branch of a repo, this feature solves the issue of unauthorized persons changing code or different aspects of your files for instance. Yes changes can be made by contributors but they would not be authorized to push those changes to the main branch without authority.


## Question 9

What happens when you `fork` a repository?

When a repository is forked it means that an independent copy of the file was made. Forking a file means that there would be no connection between the forked repo and the remote repository it was forked from. Therefore the action itself would not be noticed or in other words the originator of the forked repo would have no knowledge of the fork.  Also, since it is not synchronized, previous contributors would have no access to any changes/updates made as the forked repo would bare no relationship to the repository it was forked from. However, a pull request can be done to merge a forked repo with the original one. Only then changes can be reviewed by others. we must also remember that no commands are used to do a 'fork' as this is considered a concept.

What happens when you clone a repository?

When a repository is cloned a copy of the targeted repo is then stored on your local computer. It does a bit more than storing it since the originator of the targeted repo would be aware of the clone. If the developer cloning does not have the right access they would not be able to push changes to the remote repo but instead would have to fork the cloned repo and then do a pull request so that others can see the changes made. Cloning is a process and uses the command git clone.

## Question 11

What is a Pull Request?

After a remote repository is cloned/forked and changes have been made to it locally, a pull request can be made in order for the changes to be viewed/reviewed on Github by the developer who established the main branch and by other developers. Pull requests are useful because a number of persons can make an input to code and these changes can be reviewed before a decision is made on whether to push the changes or not.

## Question 12

What is the Git History log?
Git History can be accessed by running the git log command in the Terminal. It displays a list of each commit—the ref ID, the author, the date, the commit message, and if it’s the HEAD of any branches. It is useful for tracking git commits.



## Question 13

What does it mean to "push" changes to Github?

A 'push' to Github means that one has decided to transfer a commit/s to a remote repository. Hence it means transferring a local repository to a remote location (Github). You must however be authorized to perform this task, if not you will need to do a pull request.

## Question 14

What is Github?

If we understand Git, Github is easier to define. With that being said, Git is an open source version control software that tracks and stores changes made to a file. It also includes who made the change and when, for example. GitHub is a web based location where files can be stored. For instance, we can send files that Git tracked to Github (push, pull request). We can also make our own copy of a public file stored on Github by doing a 'fork' or we can download a 'clone' of a specified repo. Each of the mentions have different features as explained earlier. Github lets multiple users make separate changes to web pages at the same time an it can also be defined as a social networking space for developers since it is used for code sharing.

## Question 15

What does it mean to "Commit your changes"?

To commit your changes means that you are recording changes made to a file or files in your branch. It also records when the change/s were made an who made the change/s. It is similar to saving a file locally. Each commit is assigned a unique ID at this stage which is called a hash of SHA. Committing does not make changes to the remote repository. We must also note that committing can be done multiple times before a push or pull request. In other words it is not mandatory to push or pull every commit.

## Question 16

What program do we use to write code at CodeYourFuture?

We use Visual Studio Code.

## Question 17

What do you use "Commit Messages" for?

Commit messages are used to store a message that identifies or explains an update.

## Question 18

Where can I look to find help with Git?

To get help with Git you can read the slides about Git on CYF website, there is a cheat sheet there as well or you can look on Google and on YouTube. You can even reach out to your peers or the volunteers for help.
