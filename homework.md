## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

Git and GitHub solve three key problems commonly encountered in software development and collaboration:

1. Git tracks changes to files over time, allowing developers to view   history, compare versions, and roll back to earlier states if needed. This eliminates the risk of losing work or overwriting important changes.
2. GitHub provides a centralized platform for multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously. Features like pull requests, branches, and issue tracking enable seamless teamwork and conflict resolution.
3. GitHub stores code in the cloud, ensuring it is secure and accessible from anywhere. This reduces the risk of losing code due to hardware failures or local mishaps.

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

When we fork a repository ,basically we creating a copy of that repository.It allows to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original work.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

When we clone a repository it create a local copy of the repository on our computer, including its entire history, branches, and files. This allows us to work on the project locally and sync changes with the remote repository as needed.

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

It is a feature in GitHub that allows developers to propose changes to a repository by submitting their work for review. It enables collaboration by allowing maintainers to review, discuss, and merge the proposed changes into the main project.
