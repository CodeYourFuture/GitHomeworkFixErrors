## 2. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a versatile, lightweight programming language primarily used for adding interactivity and dynamic content to web pages. It complements HTML and CSS, allowing web developers to create engaging user experiences, from simple animations to complex web applications. Beyond web development, JavaScript is also used for server-side development with Node.js, game development, and more. 

## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

What is GitHub used for? GitHub allows you to create, store, change, merge, and collaborate on files or code. Any team member can access the GitHub repository (think of this as a folder for files) and see the most recent version in real time. Then, they can make edits or changes that the other collaborators also see.

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

Forking a repository means you can make any changes you want to the code without affecting the original project. You can choose to share those changes with the original repo through the pull request process.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A pull request (PR) is a request to merge changes from one branch of a codebase into another, often the main branch. It's essentially a proposal to integrate new code, features, or fixes into the project's main development line. The PR allows for code review and discussion before the changes are actually merged, promoting collaboration and quality control.
