## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

 - Version Cotnrol: Git helps track changes to your code, allowing you to revert to previous changes if any mistakes were made and records a history of those changes so that it is easy to ga back to a correct version.
 - Collaboration: GitHub offers a platform for developers to work on the same project at the same time, it manages their individual contributions through 'branching' meaning contributors aren't all contributing to the one and only file on a project all at the same time which would cause conflicts. Github helps developers to resolve any merge conflicts.
 - Code sharing and Reviews: Github makes it easy to share code with others, allows others to leave feedback and review any changes through features like 'Pull Requests'

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

'Forking' a repository means that you create a copy of the original repository but in your own GitHub account, so you can make any changes you want without affecting the original repository.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

'Cloning' a repository means that you create a local copy of the repository on your computer (or "local machine"). This means you can work offline, make changes and push them back to the 'remote' repository (the original repository you cloned).

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A PR or 'Pull Request' is a feature that allows you to propose code changes to a repository. You ask the original repository owners/managers to review the changes that you've made to any of the code in the codebase in your branch before merging them into the main branch.
