## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

Forking a repository means you can make any changes you want to the code without affecting the original project. You can choose to share those changes with the original repo through the pull request process.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

When you clone a repository, you copy the repository from GitHub.com to your local machine. Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub.com has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project.

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A pull request is a proposal to merge a set of changes from one branch into another. In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.
