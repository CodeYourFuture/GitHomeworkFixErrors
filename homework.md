## Question 7

What is JavaScript?

My understanding of JavaScript is that it is a very useful programming language which is used to create interactive effects on a webpage. For example, JavaScript can enable a webpage to simply collect data inputted to a particular field but one can also tell the computer using the javascript language what it should do with the collected data. For instance, maybe we want to store the collected data in a particular order/format. We can then use JavaScript to achieve this goal.

## Question 8

What three problem does Git & Github solve?


1. Once our files are tracked by Git and pushed to Github the platform stores a copy of those files hence solving the problem of deleting a file in error on your local computer.
2. Because Git and GitHub serves as a version control it keeps a very detailed record or log of files which then allows us to track changes such as dates and times they were made etc. Since it has such precise capabilities it solves the problem of having to spend time searching for errors in our code if there is a bug as GitHub clearly pinpoints this information for us.
3. Last but not least, another feature of GitHub is control, though public, only the creator of a  main branch of a repository has authority to change or update the main branch of a repo, this feature solves the issue of unauthorized persons changing code or different aspects of your files for instance. Yes changes can be made by contributors but they would not be authorized to push those changes to the main branch without authority.

## Question 9

What happens when you `fork` a repository?

When a repository is forked it means that an independent copy of the file/s were made. Forking a file means that there would be no connection between the forked repo and the remote repository it was forked from. Therefore the action itself would not be noticed or in other words the originator of the forked repo would have no knowledge of the fork.  Also, since it is not synchronized, previous contributors would have no access to any changes/updates made as the forked repo would bare no relationship to the repository it was forked from. However, a pull request can be done to merge a forked repo with the original one. Only then changes can be reviewed by others. we must also remember that no commands are used to do a 'fork' as this is considered a concept.

## Question 10 

What happens when you clone a repostory?

It send it to a local computer

## Question 11

What is a Pull Request?

After a remote repository is cloned/forked and changes have been made to it locally, a pull request can be made in order for the changes to be viewed/reviewed on Github by the developer who established the main branch and by other developers. Pull requests are useful because a number of persons can make an input to code and these changes can be reviewed before a decision is made on whether to push the changes or not.

## Question 12

Send you code to Github

## Question 16

What program do we use to write code at CodeYourFuture?

visual studio

## Question 17

To record what changes you made to the code

## Question 18
