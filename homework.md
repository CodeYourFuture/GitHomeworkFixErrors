## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

Forking a repository means you can make any changes you want to the code without affecting the original project. You can choose to share those changes with the original repo through the pull request process.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A pull request (PR), also known as a merge request, is a formal request in software development to merge changes from one branch (often a feature branch) into another, typically the main branch. It allows for code review and discussion before the changes are integrated into the main codebase.
