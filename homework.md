Hyper Text Mark  UP Language

'HTML (HyperText Mark up Language) is the most basic building block of the Web. It defines the meaning and structure of web content. Other technologies besides HTML are generally used to describe a web page's appearance/presentation (CSS) or functionality/behaviour (JavaScript).

"Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.'

## Question 6

Using CSS, how would I select every `<h1>` tag on the page?

Answer:
In order to target the <h1> tags you must write this particular code on the CSS page.
------------------------
CSS:
h1{

};
--------------------------

Background information:

The general taught convention by most web developers is/was that there should generally be only one <h1> tag used in the html syntax. This is because many developers believed/ believe that more than one <h1> tag would disrupt that particular website on the Google SEO
ranking system.

However according to representatives from 'Google Web masters' using more than one <h1> tag will currently not affect your websites place on the Google SEO ranking system.Further the representive advised that the developer use their own discreation when design the website in accordance to users needs.

A believe on why developers should only use one <h1>: 

Part 1 of the answer: Why you should only use one <h1> tag:
'You should only use one <h1> per page. Using more than one will not result in an error, but using only one is seen as a best practice. It makes logical sense — <h1> is the most important heading, and tells you what the purpose of the overall page is. You wouldn't have a book with more than one title, or a movie with more than one name! Having a single top-level title is also arguably better for screen reader users, and SEO.'

## Question 7

What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is a programme utilised in front-end web development. Essentially JavaScript is controls the behaviour of a website making it more interactive in terms of user engagement.

'JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.'

## Question 8

What three problem does Git & Github solve?

1 It allows web developers to effectively track changes made to the syntax of web development project. In addition the software also also web development teams to identify which person made what changes to a web project.

2 It prevents the accident loss of web project through human era (web developers) or computer hardware failure.

3 Git and GitHub is a means for web developers working on a project together to effectively collaborate and work on projects. Communication is a key part of the software developer can describe what changes they have done to a project or what contributions they would like to make on a particular project.

## Question 9

What happens when you `fork` a repository?

'fork
A fork is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your account. Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original upstream repository. You can also open a pull request in the upstream repository and keep your fork synced with the latest changes since both repositories are still connected.'

## Question 10 

What happens when you clone a repostory?

'Cloning a repository
When you create a repository on GitHub, it exists as a remote repository. You can clone your repository to create a local copy on your computer and sync between the two locations.'

## Question 11

What is a Pull Request?

'Pull request
Pull requests are proposed changes to a repository submitted by a user and accepted or rejected by a repository's collaborators. Like issues, pull requests each have their own discussion forum.'

Topic: Definition of a Pull request 
Reference: 'https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/github-glossary#pull' accessed (01.11.2020)
------------------------------

'About pull requests
Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.'

Topic: About pull requests 
Reference: 'https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests'accessed:(01.11.2020)
------------------------------

'Open a Pull Request
Nice edits! Now that you have changes in a branch off of main, you can open a pull request.

Pull Requests are the heart of collaboration on GitHub. When you open a pull request, you’re proposing your changes and requesting that someone review and pull in your contribution and merge them into their branch. Pull requests show diffs, or differences, of the content from both branches. The changes, additions, and subtractions are shown in green and red.

As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request and start a discussion, even before the code is finished.

By using GitHub’s @mention system in your pull request message, you can ask for feedback from specific people or teams, whether they’re down the hall or 10 time zones away.

You can even open pull requests in your own repository and merge them yourself. It’s a great way to learn the GitHub flow before working on larger projects.'

## Question 12

What is the Git History log?

This is a record of all the commits made to the branch of the Git branch.However it is important to note that in order to perform this action it differs from 'GitHub Desktop and 'Git'.

'You can see details about any commit in GitHub Desktop, including a diff of the changes the commit introduced.'

## Question 13

What does it meant to "push" changes to Github?

'As you commit changes to your project locally, you can push those changes to GitHub so that others may access them from the remote repository.
People with write permissions can push changes to a repository.'

Reference:'' accessed:(01.11.2020)

'Git PUSH
The git push command is used to transfer or push the commit, which is made on a local branch in your computer to a remote repository like GitHub. The command used for pushing to GitHub is given below.
git push 'remote_name' 'branch_name'
In this tutorial, you'll be looking two different ways to PUSH to GitHub'

## Question 14

What is Github?
GitHub is a patented type of software which is a version control system (VCS), giving people the opportunity to:
-Track the history of file changes
-Collaborate with other globally
-Work remotely 
-Protect and store web development projects

'All developers will use some kind of version control system (VCS), a tool to allow them to collaborate with other developers on a project without danger of them overwriting each other's work, and roll back to previous versions of the code base if a problem is discovered later on. The most popular VCS (at least among web developers) is Git, along with GitHub, a site that provides hosting for your repositories and several tools for working with them. This module aims to teach you what you need to know about both of them.'

******************************************************************************************
## Question 15

What does it mean to "Commit your changes"?

'Similar to saving a file that's been edited, a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch. Git assigns each commit a unique ID, called a SHA or hash, that identifies:

-The specific changes
-When the changes were made
-Who created the changes
-When you make a commit, you must include a commit message that briefly describes the changes. You can also add a co-author on any commits you collaborate on.

If the commits you make in GitHub Desktop are associated with the wrong account on GitHub, update the email address in your Git configuration using GitHub Desktop. For more information, see'

******************************************************************************************

## Question 17

What do you use "Commit Messages" for?

'What is a commit message?
The commit command is used to save changes to a local repository after staging in Git. However, before you can save changes in Git, you have to tell Git which changes you want to save as you might have made tons of edits. A great way to do that is by adding a commit message to identify your changes.'

Topic: Git commit messages

******************************************************************************************
## Question 18

Where can I look to find help with Git?
Answer:

1.Before asking for help a developer should record the problem and clearly specify:
-What is the problem?
-What do you need clarification on ('topic')?

Reference: Topic:'How to ask questions as a developer on Stack overflow'
https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask

2.Developers should try to solve the problem first by conducting research and trying out many different solutions. Often when we are stuck on a problem this a moment that we can use to learn, however this depends on the urgency of the problem and or if time is not an issue.
