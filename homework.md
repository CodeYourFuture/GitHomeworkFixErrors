## 1. What is 2 + 2?

4

## 2. What is JavaScript?

A computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.

## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

1-Version Control:
Git tracks changes to source code over time, allowing developers to save versions (commits), revert to previous states, and see the history of modifications. This prevents loss of work and helps in managing changes efficiently.

2-Collaboration:
GitHub provides a centralized platform for teams to collaborate on code. Features like pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking make it easier for multiple developers to work together, propose changes, and merge contributions without overwriting each other's work.

3-Backup and Remote Access:
By hosting repositories in the cloud, GitHub serves as a remote backup of the codebase. Developers can access the latest version of their project from anywhere, and the risk of losing code due to local failures is reduced.

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

You create your own copy of someone else's repository under your GitHub account.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

 You create a local copy of a remote repository on your computer.

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

A Pull Request (PR) is a way to propose changes you've made in a branch or a forked repository back to the original repository on GitHub.
