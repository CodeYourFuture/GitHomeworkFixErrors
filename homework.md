## 1. What is 2 + 2?

4

## 2. What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is the programming language that almost all applications that run on the web, use for their frontend.

## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

- Save work - prevents you from losing your old work, and allows you to revert to older versions of your project (like Google Docs, or Word). Without it, it would be really difficult to save your work and manage different versions of your project.
- Branches - allows you to work on experimental features without affecting the bulk of your application. Without branches, you're prone to breaking your application, everytime you want to make a change.
- Showcase work - GitHub allows you to share your work with others, without a version control system, it is hard for others to see each change you've made in your project.

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

Forking a repository means you are making a copy of a repository. Anything you do to a forked repository, doesn't effect the original repository, unless you merge your changes into it.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

When you clone a repository, you are adding it to the filesystem on your local machine.

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

When you send a file over the internet
