A place for us to store and share our code.
 GitHub is a website for developers and programmers to collaboratively work on code.

## Question 15

What does it mean to "Commit your changes"?

Send you code to Github
The "commit" command is used to save your changes to the local repository. Note that you have to explicitly tell Git which changes you want to include in a commit before running the "git commit" command. This means that a file won't be automatically included in the next commit just because it was changed.
## Question 16

What program do we use to write code at CodeYourFuture?

Microsoft Word
Visual studio code
## Question 17

What do you use "Commit Messages" for?

To record what changes you made to the code
A “commit” command saves all the edits made to a local repository after it's placed in Git. You make tons of edits that you might not be able to recall later. So, before making the changes to any command line, you have to inform Git about it. A Git Commit Message helps identify all the changes in the documentation.
