# Linus's Homework

## 1. What is 2 + 2?

4

## 2. What is JavaScript?

A high-level object oriented programming language used to create interactive websites. 

## 3. What three problems does Git & GitHub solve?

Git and Github can help by giving their users the possibility to know which one is the latest version of a project, who applied the changes and when. This helps avoiding confusion and inefficiency.

Github works as backup, allowing the user to access their data from anywhere. This helps in case of data-loss.

It is also a good tool for collaboration, it helps managing conflicts when multiple developers are working n the same project and merges the different versions of a file.

## 4. What happens when you `fork` a repository?

Forking will create a copy of a repository part of an existing project on your Github account. This allows to make changes by creating a separate branch of the project, so the changes can be checked before the final version of a file is released.

## 5. What happens when you clone a repository?

Cloning a repository means downloading a copy of the project on your local machine.

## 6. What is a Pull Request?

It is how the changes made on the forked repository are submitted. With a pull request, the owner of the project can review the proposed changes and merge them into the main project.
