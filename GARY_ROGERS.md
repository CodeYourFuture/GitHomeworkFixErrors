An introduction to me - Gary Rogers

My favourite sport is Triathlon - I was a budding triathlete when younger and maintain an interest in the sport

My favourite food is Steak - but I so rarely get to eat it due to poverty

I love this song - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7bKe_Zgk4o

An interesting fact about me is that I share my birthday with Alan Turing...(and it's today!)
