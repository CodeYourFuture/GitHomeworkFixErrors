# Git Homework - Fix Errors

My child - Linus - came home today from school with his homework but he got SOME of the questions wrong!

Can you help him to fix or improve the answers to his homework?

1. You should `fork` this repository
2. Clone the repository to your computer
3. Create a branch with an appropriate name for the task you're on
3. Fix the errors in Linus's homework in `homework.md`
4. Create a Pull Request back to this repository with the correct answers. Make sure your Pull Request is created in CodeYourFuture's fork, not your personal fork.
